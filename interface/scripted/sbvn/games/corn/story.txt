i must find the corn before the ancients find me
for it is against the law to not have corn inside me at all times.

haha yes, this is indeed a corn portal. the corn emerges.

**INSIDE YOU**

**ASCENSION**

**YES**

mmm... cr unchy...
*[you take a nice cromch, and feel yourself being violently obliterated by a small planetoid flying at mach 8 in your general direction.]*

my very being has been turned into corn
i am.. inside the corn.
i see a hook.. (**ride it**)

**RIDE IT**
*[you ride the hook into the sky, and reach a large, pink being at the top.]*
The being speaks. "beep beep im a jeep", he says.
It is patman!
haha yes. *[patman pulls out his dimensional hammer, and beats you with it until only a puddle of corn juice remains.]*
*[after scronching you, he proceeds to annihilate the rest of the universe.]* (**the end** haha)

**VOID**
you return to the void, and stay there forever. at least you got to keep your corn.

**THE END**
